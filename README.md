Iris Classification ML App
This project demonstrates a complete end‑to‑end machine learning workflow using Python and scikit‑learn.
It includes training a model, evaluating it, saving the trained artifact, and preparing the project for deployment on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces and Fly.io.

The goal is to showcase a clean, professional ML project structure suitable for portfolios and real‑world ML engineering practices.

Dataset & Prediction Goal
This project uses the classic Iris dataset, one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning. It contains measurements of iris flowers and their corresponding species. The goal of the model is to predict the species of an iris flower based on four numeric features.

Iris Species
The dataset includes three species:

Iris setosa

Iris versicolor

Iris virginica

Each species has distinct petal and sepal characteristics, making it suitable for classification tasks.

Features Used for Prediction
Each flower is described by:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

These measurements are used as input to the machine learning model.

Prediction Task
The trained Random Forest model takes the four measurements as input and predicts one of the three iris species. This is a multi-class classification problem, and the Iris dataset is ideal for demonstrating end‑to‑end ML workflows.
